# T.88 MQ arithmetic core

This note describes [issue #45](https://github.com/rwv/caj2pdf-rust/issues/45):
an original MIT Rust decoder for the arithmetic **control flow** of one
explicitly delimited ITU-T T.88 (02/2000) MQ stream. It emits individual
decisions for a caller-selected context. It does not parse a JBIG2 image
procedure, choose pixel contexts, assemble rows, or claim CAJ image support.
The exact 47 probability states remain caller-supplied while
[issue #44](https://github.com/rwv/caj2pdf-rust/issues/44) resolves their
redistribution status.

## Source and algorithm boundary

The primary reference is the [official T.88 (02/2000) edition](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.88-200002-S/en).
The local official English PDF used for this implementation had SHA-256
`a94850aa659f4c5267051d1e17081dc4ffd04531c3d659c6bc2835802035ec69`.
Annex E.2.5/Table E.1 specifies the caller-supplied state fields. Annex
E.2.9–E.2.10 describes FLUSH, trimming, and the terminal marker. Annex
E.3.1–E.3.5 specifies the decoder registers, decision exchanges,
renormalization, byte input, and initialization. Annex H.2/Table H.1 provides
the opt-in 256-decision check. Annex E.3.6 describes marker resynchronization
as indicative of an error and does not standardize a recovery procedure.
Annex G is an **informative alternative** coding convention; it does not
establish that a T.82 arithmetic decoder or its state table can be reused.

The module implements those public algorithms independently and imports no
decoder source. It reuses only this repository's MIT `RangedSource`,
`read_exact_at`, `Limits`, and `Cancellation` contracts. No T.88 Table
E.1 row, Annex H vector byte, or derived pixel data is in source, tests,
generated files, binaries, or packages.

T.82 `qm.rs` has a caller-provided 113-state table and receives an already
unstuffed stripe span. Its three-byte initialization, virtual zero padding,
and context carry/reset rules follow T.82. T.88 `jbig2::mq` has 47 states,
initializes from the first byte and a `BYTEIN` call followed by a seven-bit
shift, and handles `0xFF` lookahead and seven-bit stuffing within its own
span. A `0xFF 0xAC` terminal pair supplies synthetic one-bits through
`BYTEIN`; it is not T.82 virtual zero padding. The image procedure, not this
core, decides when to reset or preserve each T.88 context.

## API and bounds

`MqTable::new` accepts exactly 47 `(qe, next_mps, next_lps, switch_mps)`
rows, rejecting zero or out-of-range `qe` and any transition beyond index
46. `MqContexts::new` allocates a caller-limited number of context records
initially at state zero and MPS zero. The caller selects an absolute
`MqSpan { offset, length }` in a stable-size `RangedSource` and a
`MqBudget`. `MqDecoder::new` checks the span end, source size, input limit,
and combined table/context/buffer allocation limit before reading. Each
`decode_bit(context)` returns one bit, updating the borrowed context bank.
`finish(expected_symbols)` verifies the count and the exact terminal
`0xFF 0xAC` pair at the declared span's end. It does not prove that every
preceding source byte is semantically required by an image model.

The decoder owns a fixed 256-byte input buffer, bounded by the configured
I/O chunk size, plus constant-size registers; it borrows the state table and
context bank. Working memory is `O(context_count + 256)`, independent of
the source document and decoded image area. The work budget charges symbol
decisions, renormalization shifts, byte-input operations, and every physical
byte fetched into the buffer. Separate caps cover span length, contexts,
symbols, work, and repeated synthetic terminal inputs. The symbol, work, and
terminal-input caps must each be at most `MAX_BUDGET_COUNT` (2^48); a larger
value is rejected as `InvalidBudget` before any I/O, so the running counters
use plain arithmetic that provably cannot overflow. Short reads are
retried within the declared span. A zero read or physical truncation within
it is a located source error; a request past its end is a terminal error.
`0xFF` followed by a nonterminal marker or by `0xAC` before the span tail
is malformed. The decoder never borrows bytes from the next segment.

`MqSnapshot` reports A/C/CT, the current absolute source offset, physical
bytes fetched (including bounded lookahead), synthetic terminal inputs,
symbol count, work, and poisoned state. A future dropped while a decision is
pending leaves the decoder poisoned because its registers may already have
changed; it refuses further decoding. Errors carry the source coordinate
and context where available. If a caller wraps or spools a source, its
original document offset mapping remains that caller's responsibility.

The local read-only inventory for #9 found `0xFF 0xAC` at the ends of all
2,184 observed arithmetic segment-data spans across 546 type-3 images.
That observation supports the declared whole-span terminal policy for this
profile; it does not establish the boundaries of internal MQ substreams or
the general validity of every JBIG2 segment. Those questions remain with
the segment and pixel-model work in #42 and #43.

## Verification and status

The required `mq_core` integration tests use an **invented** 47-row state
machine and tiny synthetic streams. They assert independently calculated
bits and A/C/CT values, `0xFF` stuffing, terminal input, source and budget
errors, cancellation, pending-future safety, and fixed-budget mutations.
These establish bounded behavior, not standard compatibility.

The ignored [Annex H.2 harness](../../crates/caj2pdf-core/tests/mq_t88_external.rs)
requires an externally held text fixture under `/tmp`. Its first line is
`T88-2000-H2`, followed by `47`, 47 decimal
`qe next_mps next_lps switch` lines, `4`, then four decimal
`before_symbol A C CT` lines for positions 0, 1, 2, and 7 in Table H.1.
The final two lines are lowercase hex for the 30-byte encoded stream and
32-byte expected decisions in Annex H.2. The test caps the file at 16 KiB
and verifies SHA-256
`bdf6eeeca3bc5d5a8dc1a13acc7698ec356c886b27f6526f3e09fc2c8520ac57`
**before parsing**. No official data is checked into Git.

```sh
CAJ2PDF_T88_H2_FIXTURE_FILE=/tmp/caj2pdf-t88-2000-h2-private.fixture \
  cargo test --locked -p caj2pdf-core --test mq_t88_external -- --ignored --nocapture
```

The local run on 2026-09-24 passed all 256 Annex H.2 decisions, four
Table H.1 A/C/CT checkpoints, and the terminal marker. Ordinary CI leaves
the ignored test **NOT_RUN**. Explicitly requesting it with a missing,
changed, oversized, or malformed fixture fails. An Annex H.2 pass neither
resolves Table E.1 redistribution in #44 nor establishes HN/C8 or CAJ
pixel parity. [Issue #49](jbig2-generic-template2.md) now uses this core for
one bounded template-2 generic-region slice; the exact table rights gate in
#44 and the missing symbol/text/page procedures still prevent a standalone
or integrated production pixel decoder.
