# Issue #117: predeclared source-page composition validation

<!-- SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT -->

Status: FROZEN BEFORE EXECUTION, 2026-09-28 UTC. No private PDF extraction, rendering, source-byte inspection, table-byte inspection, or new converter call was performed while drafting and reviewing this plan. Public repository metadata and existing external JSON reports supplied the pins below. A separate execution receipt must bind the final original native example, Rust/Cargo source fingerprint, runner/tests, executable, compiler versions, effective environment and command to this committed plan before any private call.

Pre-execution amendment, 2026-09-28 UTC: extend only the original development metadata extractor with an explicit `allow_raw_bilevel` keyword for native candidates. Its old default and reference extraction remain unchanged. Original synthetic PDFs and real qpdf/MuPDF/Poppler tests establish the new unfiltered one-bit DeviceGray profile, explicit inverse `Decode [1 0]`, exact raw stream length and rejection of masks, parameters and additional dictionary keys. No private input was consulted for this extension. The updated helper identity is pinned below. The external receipt binds the reviewed source commit, parent environment, command and executable/library identities; the runner also writes an immutable internal receipt binding its exact generated session, child `TMPDIR`/environment and public source/helper fingerprints before the first private baseline/source/table audit.

## Scope and independence

Base: `09e77b9ff63487f7f5c7fe3512cc6dc90587aa6b` in `/tmp/caj2pdf-issue117-page-composition`.

Implement the native diagnostic and Python verifier independently under MIT. Inspect neither the Python/Go/private Rust nor other converter implementation. The native program receives only original source, output PDF, caller-supplied table and caller-owned scratch paths; it receives no oracle, reference PDF, source ID/hash dispatch, reference matrix or image/pixel array. The verifier separately reads the pinned public metadata and external PDFs. Reuse the six already-produced reference PDFs; **maximum new Python converter launches: zero**. No private source mutation, blind retry or tolerance expansion is authorized by this plan.

This evidence covers these already observed documents and profiles. It does not establish unseen formats, vendor-defined coordinate units, text/bookmark parity, an authorized bundled T.82 table, types 1/3, production CLI/JavaScript dispatch, or HN-B text conversion. The native diagnostic and caller-table API remain subject to #10, #30 and the release-policy gates.

It records six deterministic PDFs and 27 source before/after audits. Resolve the following paths from the report and verify their exact hashes again; do not infer them from matching filenames.

Corpus root: `/tmp/caj2pdf-ranged-corpus`. Audit all 27 HN/C8 matrix rows, not only the three selected sources, before and after.

Hash-audit all six PDFs before/after. Extract metadata, samples and pixels from run1 of each profile; run2 is byte-identical and remains an audit input, not extra independent evidence.

Caller runtime table: `/tmp/caj26-official-vector-with-checkpoints.txt`, currently 1745 bytes, expected complete-file SHA-256 `11fe241dedbbf4faa542af4a1485566c2794fa69e5c06e2e5c8542adfe9b1ab7`, maximum16384 bytes. Read it only after plan freeze. The loader validates the `T82-1993` header, 113 state rows and checkpoint suffix framing (count3 and six lines), then constructs caller-supplied `QmTable`. It does not interpret checkpoint values or hex vectors; the earlier dedicated arithmetic-vector test covers them, and the complete-file SHA protects this execution. Retain no table values in reports, source fixtures, CI or artifacts intended for Git. Its use establishes no redistribution authorization.

Existing metadata-only placement report, available for history, not an additional oracle: `/tmp/issue112-placement-rule-report.json`, 115511 bytes, SHA-256 `6d892bc3d41f23f71d503c689411d2bc2f9f30ecd0fb8bcd61b1c95ec5a10048`. #112 observed 75 boxes,125 ordered CTMs,maximum residual4.91306109964e-5pt. It did not establish full-page pixel parity or exact original padding.

## Tool and runtime pins

The reference-report audit may verify converter/library identities by hash only using the existing protocol; no converter is launched and no implementation is inspected. Historical reference checkout `/tmp/caj2pdf-python-oracle` was clean at `8cbc3c5721acb762f739434eb3d206171dbb022a`; converter file SHA `c2bede4bd4e1308fb9f7ec7e5593106c5b41188c337158a61cfadadc6f81f739`; reference `/tmp/caj2pdf-jbig-oracle/libjbigdec.so` SHA `d370d071a4b7abdf7db4565c2bc85ac881470ee1a212459dd658d70974128de6`. Historical PyPDF2 dependency `/tmp/caj2pdf-oracle-pydeps`, version1.26.0, 16-file tree SHA `4d33afdda9bb9ed730fba0355c42291d3380ce93f89cf4ec489338dcd385b36c` is provenance only; new conversion does not use it.

Hash system tool binaries before/after and record effective `LC_ALL=C`, `TZ=UTC`, `PYTHONHASHSEED=0`, `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`, `PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1`, inherited environment digest, executable realpaths, version command outputs, and Rust/Cargo versions. Set `TMPDIR` to the external session scratch directory. Bind Python/native executable and original harness/source fingerprints before/after. Runtime-linked dependencies are outside the executable digest; record the resolved shared-library identity set in the execution receipt and audit it before/after if supported by the existing audit helper, or state that limitation explicitly.

## Original native caller contract

Build cache: `/home/hzc/.cache/caj2pdf-issue117-build`; `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` is set explicitly. Build the original `hnc8_page_composition` example in locked release mode. The execution receipt freezes the resulting executable/hash and full Rust/Cargo source fingerprint.

One native invocation per profile; maximum3 launches and no retries:

`NATIVE SOURCE OUTPUT_PDF TABLE_FILE SCRATCH_DIRECTORY`

All paths must be canonical and constrained to the audited input roots or newly created external session. The table is optional at the library boundary; this diagnostic supplies the audited caller table for every profile, including HN-B, without source-specific dispatch. Output sink and scratch adapter are platform wrappers, separate from core conversion. Use the existing original temporary-file `RandomAccessScratch` adapter. Truncate/reset row store between images, verify checked offsets/short I/O, and remove it on success/error/cancellation. It is random-access disk, never a whole-page/whole-image memory vector.

Call `convert_source_pages_pdf(source,sink,Some(&table),scratch,visitor,options,limits,cancel)` with explicit frozen parameters:

- `Limits`: I/O4096 bytes; input8GiB; output128MiB; maximum single checked handler allocation1MiB; pages4096; bookmarks4096.
- Container `Budget`: outline records4096; images per page256; total images16384; text span1MiB; image span64MiB.
- `TextBudget`: encoded span1MiB; decoded bytes1MiB; records65536; images256; working bytes1MiB.
- `JpegBudget`: payload64MiB; markers100000; work64MiB.
- `Type0Budget`: width32768; height32768; pixels12000000; context work120000000.
- `ArithmeticBudget`: symbols12032768; work385049600 (`12032768*32+1024`).
- `ComposeBudget`: page metadata65536 bytes; row store2097152 bytes; requested row-store I/O per image268435456 bytes.
- No arbitrary CTM adjustment, clipping, source-coordinate normalization or rounding. Use the original source-derived profile through core composition. The public semantic CTM threshold is absolute0.00005pt in every component.

The native visitor streams metadata for every source row, including HN-B image-free rows. It does not retain document-wide pixel/placement arrays. Bound stdout to1MiB and each line to2048 bytes. Output variant, source/output page counts, explicit source-to-output mapping, source page row/text/image metadata, image-order records/types/payload spans, visible/display dimensions, page boxes, and all six CTM components. Use shortest round-trip finite decimals. Include measured source/sink/scratch requests and bytes, page-metadata/text/row-store peaks, Type0/JPEG counts, and no-image row count. Runtime tables/text/sample bytes never appear in stdout or reports.

## Stage1: metadata, identity, order and full padded Type0 arrays

Read the committed oracle and matrix under1MiB caps. Independently reopen all3 selected baseline PDFs and all3 native PDFs with the existing bounded qpdf/MuPDF/Poppler metadata extractor. Do not trust native visitor output alone.

Reference extraction uses the unchanged DCT/Flate default. Only native extraction enables `allow_raw_bilevel`; for every such XObject, a bounded qpdf object-JSON query must prove the exact inverse-gray dictionary profile, and qpdf/MuPDF raw stream observations must agree on all bytes and the exact packed row length. This additional dictionary query counts against the same tool/deadline/resource ceilings.

Require81/81 source rows accounted,77/77 output pages,127/127 ordered draws (HN-A68/91,C8 7/34,HN-B6source rows/2pages/2draws). HN-A/C8 mappings are1..68 and1..7. HN-B image counts must remain `[1,0,0,0,0,1]`, output mapping `[1,6]`, no-image source rows2..5 counted explicitly; their unsupported text is not a converted text pass.

For every output page and draw, compare boxes, all6 ordered CTM components, source descriptor/payload spans, image record numbers/types, visible width, display width, height and bit depth. CTM/box tolerance0.00005pt. Expected Type0 display width is the independently observed `stride_width=ceil(visible_width/32)*32`, not a scaled visible-width image. Compare all53 JPEG raw streams exactly against their original oracle payload SHA-256/length, independent qpdf and MuPDF extraction hashes. Native object IDs/resource names may differ; compare their ordered draw association and actual stream content, not reference ID numbers. Reference Type0 Indexed white/black palette and native one-bit DeviceGray with explicit inverse decode can be different dictionaries only when independently verified to map each stored bit to the same black/white sample. Never require encoded-Flate-byte equality; require decoded sample equality.

For each of the74 Type0 images, inspect bounded image dictionaries and extract complete filtered sample arrays with `qpdf --show-object=ID --filtered-stream-data PDF`. Only the measured one-bit, no-predictor, known black/white dictionary profile is accepted; anything else fails/unsupported, never guessed. Require exact sample byte count `display_width/8*height`, all padded columns and all stored rows. Normalize only proven palette/polarity into black=1. Compute forward and reverse-row hashes for orientation diagnosis. Compare every byte/bit at the same stored-row coordinate with native output; **zero bit differences required**. No trimming, masking, invented zeros, normalized padding, best-fit row reversal or skipped rows. Record forward/reverse digests and whether equality is forward, reverse-only or neither; only forward after declared dictionary normalization passes.

Separately invoke `pdfimages -f PAGE -l PAGE -j PDF PREFIX` for the pages containing Type0 images, parse every extracted Type0 P4/P5/P6 raster under strict exact dimensions/lengths, and canonicalize each proven binary black/white pixel into packed black=1. Require every grayscale/RGB component to be exactly0 or255, require RGB channels equal, and pack **every display-width sample**, including padding. P4 width is a multiple32, so there are no unused low bits. Match its complete array against qpdf's canonical sample array and the candidate's complete array. Locate images by ordered page/image association, never an unverified filename index. JPEG outputs from `-j` are byte-hashed/checked or discarded under the same cap; no JPEG image silently omitted. If Poppler exposes a different valid wrapper profile, stop and report it; do not silently widen accepted format rules.

This stage explicitly covers row direction and exact padding, which the older selected-image harness's visible-bit masking/zero-padding reconstruction did not prove. All74 images must pass both full-array observations before full-page compatibility can pass.

## Stage2: every complete-page pixel, two renderers

Render all77 complete pages (all75 HN-A/C8 and both HN-B outputs), for baseline and candidate, once with **each** required renderer. Maximum308 render launches: `77 pages *2 PDFs *2 renderers`. Do not render selected interior samples, ignore margins, use neighborhood envelopes, remove edge rows, align images post hoc, downsample comparisons or fit a flip/shift. Compare each renderer only with its own baseline at identical fixed options; cross-renderer hashes need not agree.

Commands, with1-based page `P`:

- MuPDF: `/usr/bin/mutool draw -q -r 300 -A 0 -c rgb -F pnm -o - PDF P`.
- Poppler: `/usr/bin/pdftoppm -r 300 -singlefile -aa no -aaVector no -f P -l P PDF` (no output prefix; bounded P6 output on stdout).

Accept only strict8-bit binary P6 RGB with exact expected dimensions, no trailing data, and a capped header.300dpi is frozen because the measured0.24pt/pixel model yields one device pixel per displayed source pixel and includes every padding sample. RGB preserves colored supplemental JPEGs. Disabling vector/text antialiasing avoids an uncontrolled renderer-setting difference; image interpolation remains each renderer's own fixed behavior on both PDFs. The rounded public CTMs are close but not mathematically identical to native shortest-decimal CTMs. At300dpi0.00005pt is at most0.000208334device pixels; **that is not permission to accept pixel differences**.

Pixel gate: exact equality of every RGB channel at every page coordinate, **maximum channel difference0, absolute-difference sum0, changed pixels0**. Also require identical complete raster SHA-256/byte count and exact expected width/height. Report worst channel difference, integer total absolute difference, changed channel/pixel counts, mean absolute channel difference, and nonwhite pixel counts for both images. These are diagnostics; no nonzero tolerance, neighborhood rule or alternate renderer setting converts a failure to a pass. If numerical phase or a renderer produces a difference, retain the failed pair and metadata, report FAIL/PARTIAL, and obtain a separately reviewed plan for follow-up rather than loosening this gate.

Validate the comparator on original MIT synthetic rasters before private execution: one changed first/last/edge pixel, reversed rows, omitted colored overlap, shifted/fractional/off-page placement, malformed/truncated/extra PNM bytes, different dimensions, all-white candidate against nonwhite baseline, and a metadata-missing blank draw. Exact pixel equality on a legitimately blank reference page is meaningful only together with that page's positive expected draw count and exact ordered geometry/complete-sample/stream gates; blank/omitted output cannot independently count as compatibility.

Public boxes predict603701450 pixels across77pages. Largest page2592x3285=8514720 pixels,25544160 RGB bytes. Total RGB payload across all308 outputs is7244417400 bytes, processed sequentially and not retained together. HN-A totals536502275 pixels, C8 59603040, HN-B7596135. Compare all channels in bounded stripes; at most two65536-byte pixel input buffers plus bounded PNM-header/row packing scratch. Save only hashes/statistics in public reports, never pixels.

## Workload and resource ceilings

- Maximum native launches3; completed/passing/failed counts recorded separately. Converter launches0. Maximum render launches308. Maximum total validator/tool launches2048, including metadata, image dictionaries/streams, extraction, rendering and version probes. Counters increment **before each attempted launch**, including launch failure/timeout/cancellation.
- External receipt preparation and closing probes are recorded separately with their actual commands/counts. The final aggregate includes these probes, the one runner launch, and its native/validator launches and must also stay within2048. Render launches are a subset of validator launches and are not counted twice.
- Deadline for whole requested experiment1800s; native timeout180s each; metadata/sample tools45s each; page render60s each. No retry.
- Child virtual-address limit1GiB. Native RSS ceiling128MiB and validator/renderer RSS ceiling512MiB, monitored where Linux `/proc` is available; successful or reaped failed-child `wait4` peak reported separately from20ms sampled peaks. A missing enforcement/measurement must be explicit, never presented as0. Memory accounting separates native checked handler allocations, named managed buffers/fixed codec reservations, harness working buffers, native/child RSS, table and disk. `Limits.max_allocation_bytes` is not total process RSS or total combined allocation.
- Hash, subprocess-drain and full-array/pixel read chunks at most65536 bytes; public metadata1MiB perfile; native stdout1MiB; diagnostics32768 bytes perchild; perline2048 bytes. No raw private stdout/stderr in committed JSON; store only hashes/byte counts/status/command, and retain raw diagnostics only externally if needed.
- Each PDF max128MiB; aggregate newly written PDFs max256MiB. Each raster/extracted sample file max64MiB; page-extraction directory max128MiB. qpdf sample arrays max64MiB but observed maximum1064340 bytes; native row store max2MiB. Type0 HN-A maximum986400bytes, C8 maximum1064340bytes.
- External root `/home/hzc/.cache/caj2pdf-issue117-validation`; create a private0700 fresh session. All native PDFs, scratch files, sample arrays, rasters and diagnostic logs use this session. `TMPDIR` points there. No heavy artifact/build output in `/tmp`; existing inputs are read in place and never mutated.
- Require at least1GiB available on the session filesystem before starting and before each expensive stage. Hard owned-session disk ceiling512MiB, monitored every20ms during child execution plus checked writes/explicit file-size caps. Do not run extraction and raster pairs simultaneously. Process onepage/one image pair at a time, delete successful samples and raster pairs immediately, reset/remove native row scratch before the next image. Retain at most the first failed pair and diagnostic metadata; abort its profile instead of accumulating further failures. Native PDFs and the metadata-only receipt/report may remain external; success leaves no raster/sample/row-spool artifact. State the ceiling covers runner-owned session files, not arbitrary tool internals outside the redirected temporary directory.
- Use bounded pipe consumers for qpdf sample/renderer PNM stdout; do not buffer whole arrays/renders in Python memory. Baseline/candidate file comparison is streamed. Enforce byte caps while consuming, not only after tools exit. Kill the complete child process group on failure/timeout/cancel/cap.

## Audits, report schema and failure semantics

Protocol: `hnc8-source-page-composition-v1`, schema1. No-input invocation returns `NOT_RUN` immediately with empty profiles/artifacts/errors, every attempted/completed/passing/failed/skipped comparison counter0, no source/table/PDF/tool reads and no child launches. Planned counts may be nonzero; actual work counts must be0. Partial arguments produceFAIL, notNOT_RUN.

Before private work, audit all27 original matrix sources; all6 baseline PDFs; matrix/layout/JBIG metadata and reference report; runtime table; required tool/Python binaries and recorded linked-runtime identities; native executable; Rust/Cargo and runner fingerprints; effective environment. Record input sizes and hashes and exact roots. Repeat these checks in `finally` after success or failure. Missing/mismatched before/after audit preventsPASS. Do not count unsupported or skipped optional cases as compatibility.

Report `planned`, `counts`, `source_audit`, `baseline_audit`, `table_audit`, `environment_audit`, `input_audit`, `native_audit`, `profiles`, `resources`, `attempts`, `errors`, `scope`, `production_composition=NOT_ENABLED`. Each profile includes native command/output digest, all source rows/mapping, expected/observed ordered metadata, each image's padded-sample or JPEG identity checks, and each full-page/per-renderer pixel digest/metrics. Actual counts separately cover81 source rows,77 pages,127 draws,74 Type0 arrays,53 JPEG streams,154 page/renderer comparisons and308 render launches. Include attempts that failed before output completion; a parsed error/output-count mismatch is not a skipped success. Each attempt records monotonically increasing launch number, kind/profile/page/image, exact argv, start/end/duration, timeout, exit code or signal, stdout/stderr sizes/hashes, peak RSS (or explicitly unavailable), and externally retained artifact paths/size/hash. No private text/table/pixel/raw stream in the report.

Store execution receipt and final report under the external session/cache. Final top-levelPASS requires every declared profile, row, draw, sample and full-page pixel gate; zero failing/skipped required work; zero new converters; all pre/post auditsPASS; resources withincaps; cleanup confirmed. A requested failure isFAIL with honest completed/remaining counts and preserved first failure; root may publish a metadata-onlyPARTIAL summary, never label remaining pages successful. The root freezes final report SHA, execution receipt, reviewed source commit and exact hosted-gate head separately.
