# Additional-image placement experiments

This is the predeclared plan and measured result for
[#110](https://github.com/rwv/caj2pdf-rust/issues/110).
The [#107 metadata oracle](hnc8-layout-oracle.md) measures 50 additional
type-2 JPEG draws on HN-A/C8 pages, but their x/y source fields remain
unknown. A measured PDF transform is an outcome, never an input to a
production placement rule. This investigation does not compose PDF pages or
alter the CLI, browser, or Node.js APIs.

## Fixed page split and evidence labels

Use HN-A pages 16, 22, 26, 29–36, 41, 47, 48 and 50 (15 pages, 16 additional
draws) and C8 pages 1–5 (5 pages, 20 draws) for discovery. Reserve HN-A pages
52–54, 57, 58, 60 and 61 (7 pages, 7 draws) and C8 pages 6–7 (2 pages,
7 draws) for the first validation pass. Both documents and every transform
are already public in the oracle: this is a predeclared page split, not a
blind independent-document test. Any formula revised after validation needs
newly generated validation cases.

Label evidence as **structural observation** (source byte-layout and checked
span), **correlation** (a candidate predicts measured transforms), or
**causal probe** (one structurally valid source change predictably changes
the black-box transform while unrelated geometry stays fixed). A rule needs
the exact source fields, units, origin, axis direction, orientation, rounding
and bounds. A lookup keyed by source ID, page number, image hash or observed
CTM is excluded.

## Hypotheses, in order

1. Check whether image order and checked pixel dimensions alone can explain
   the additional x/y translations. Fit only discovery draws and retain every
   attempted expression and its errors. The first-image page size and the
   300 dpi image scale are already pinned by #107; they are constraints rather
   than new placement evidence.
2. Treat page-row `+10`, `+12` and `+16` as unknown. Reuse the 12 #107
   one-byte results as negative observations. Do not assign coordinate
   meaning or run broad bit flips without an independently identified
   structure. A later field-specific test must state its exact offsets and
   validity checks before mutating a source.
3. Inventory bounded text-span or descriptor-adjacent metadata on the two
   discovery source pages HN-A 16 and C8 1. Record only lengths, hashes,
   candidate field offsets and structural checks. Search for independently
   framed numeric fields or commands; do not infer semantics from a coincident
   byte pattern. No raw text or source bytes enter Git.
4. Inventory type-2 JPEG marker metadata before entropy-coded scan data,
   including independently recognized density/APP fields. If a candidate
   field appears, specify whether a valid one-variable change is possible
   without changing image identity or pixel dimensions. Never mutate entropy
   data merely to force a PDF difference.
5. Construct original synthetic HN-A/C8 sources only if the independently
   measured container structure supports a bounded, valid document and the
   pinned black-box executable accepts it. Otherwise use temporary copies of
   the SHA-pinned discovery sources. No third-party converter code or
   pseudocode is consulted.

Freeze an exact probe list (source/page, field offset and width, new-value
rule, expected structural validity, predicted outcome) in this note before
running any new black-box mutations. The first batch may use at most 12
one-variable copies of the two discovery documents; additional batches need
a written reason and a new predeclared bound. Validate each copy against its
original byte by byte in 64 KiB chunks, permit only its declared changed
positions, and recheck source SHA-256 after conversion. Keep all copies and
PDFs outside Git and release artifacts.

The first causal-dependency batch is predeclared as four JFIF APP0 header
edits. Independent read-only marker checks found a baseline JFIF 1.01 APP0
segment whose two-byte JPEG length field has value 16
at the start of the second image on C8 page 1 and HN-A page 16, with unitless
1×1 density and no thumbnail. These are recognized JPEG metadata fields, not
inferred coordinate fields. The unit edit changes the single JFIF units byte
from 0 to 1; the density edit changes the low byte of big-endian Xdensity
from 1 to 2. Every other source byte must remain identical. The outcome is
unknown before the run; a PDF change does not itself establish an x/y rule.

| Probe | Source page/image | JPEG payload start | Field span | Absolute changed byte |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| C8 units | C8 p1/i2 | 94,180 | `[94193, 1]` | 94,193 |
| C8 Xdensity | C8 p1/i2 | 94,180 | `[94194, 2]` | 94,195 |
| HN-A units | HN-A p16/i2 | 1,004,167 | `[1004180, 1]` | 1,004,180 |
| HN-A Xdensity | HN-A p16/i2 | 1,004,167 | `[1004181, 2]` | 1,004,182 |

Run each probe twice in fresh directories using the same pinned reference
environment and compare its PDF SHA-256, page count, MediaBoxes, image order,
stream hashes and ordered CTMs with the unmodified reference. The selected
JPEG's encoded-stream SHA-256 must change by construction; check that its
descriptor/order and pixel dimensions stay fixed and all other image streams
remain unchanged. Validate the mutated JPEG from SOI through APP0, SOF, SOS
and EOI before launching the converter. This batch tests
whether these two JPEG fields influence output; it does not test a rule
derived from the high-entropy text span.

## Read-only exploratory checks

The initial read-only analysis performed no new black-box conversion or
mutation. It verified the pinned HN-A/C8 source hashes before and after
bounded reads. Within each variant, all selected multi-image text spans have
distinct SHA-256 values. Their first 20 text bytes are constant across the
selected pages, but HN-A and C8 have different prefixes. Their Shannon
entropy is about 7.64–7.91 bits per byte and roughly 33–36% of bytes are
printable ASCII. No complete zlib, gzip or raw-deflate decode succeeded from
offsets 0, 20, 26, 28 or 32 under a 1 MiB output cap. This does not identify
the text codec or prove that coordinates are absent.

None of the 50 additional JPEGs has APP1–APP15 or COM metadata. Each has the
same JFIF APP0 segment (length field 16) before its scan, with version 1.01, unitless
1×1 density and no thumbnail. The 14-byte APP0 data after the length field
has SHA-256
`1fb2a1c85b30a2d812c0c54aa6662cee809224a2ee52ff70bfe57604a3e7a2c8`.
Therefore the observed APP0 fields cannot distinguish the 50 placements.
Bounded scans found no exact nonzero x/y coordinate representation in the
selected text spans as ASCII decimal, little-endian f32/f64, or little-endian
i32 fixed point at scales 1, 10, 100, 1,000 or 10,000; the scan covered PDF
points and 300 dpi pixels with top and bottom origins. This is a negative
check of those encodings only. None of the 20 discovery pages has a same-length
text-span partner within its variant for a simple whole-span swap.

Simple geometry-only controls also failed. At 0.001 pt tolerance over all six
CTM components, top-left, centered and bottom-right placement each matched
0/36 discovery and 0/14 validation additional draws. A retrospective
variant-specific affine expression uses only JPEG pixel width `w`, pixel
height `h`, and one-based draw number `i`:
`x = β₀ + β₁w + β₂h + β₃i`, with a separate coefficient vector for `y`.
The remaining CTM components are `[w×72/300, 0, 0, -h×72/300]`. Ordinary
least squares fits each vector on the 36 discovery draws only; validation
reuses those coefficients. The computed coefficients are:

| Variant / output | β₀ | β₁ (`w`) | β₂ (`h`) | β₃ (`i`) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| C8 x | 499.54367644554884 | -0.2342786638436198 | 0.12029400596313929 | -15.256771580555622 |
| C8 y | 1032.3700193799978 | 0.01738695836590306 | 0.05412705732686148 | -183.73081714821825 |
| HN-A x | 227.11615316952532 | -0.08675835704195259 | 0.0017835050083312549 | -8.7737314319072 |
| HN-A y | 456.97996500655796 | 0.24606990275329801 | 0.07909983241260023 | -194.95851145614705 |

It matched 1/36 discovery and 0/14 validation draws. Maximum absolute
six-component errors were 353.8228193744678 pt and 326.6941849475608 pt,
respectively. This is a **retrospective negative exploration**: validation
CTMs were already public and inspected, so even its held-out scores are
descriptive and cannot support a new independent validation claim. The
isolated discovery match provides no placement rule.
For example, HN-A pages 32 and 33 have similar supplemental JPEG sizes
(1,887×1,717 and 1,872×1,712 pixels), but their x/y origins differ by
25.2326/134.7028 pt. The first three additional draws on C8 page 1 move
upward rather than stacking downward. A possible coordinate lattice was
noticed only after inspecting all 50 outcomes; it is post hoc, has no source
field, and is not treated as validation evidence or a placement rule.
The committed-oracle-only [analysis runner](../../scripts/hnc8_placement_analysis.py)
records the full prediction, observed CTM, six component errors and a
counterexample for every draw in each frozen split. Its maximum component
errors (discovery/validation, in pt) are 757.461/760.178 for top-left,
376.821/379.538 for center, and 648.507/525.378 for bottom-right. The
machine report also includes the affine candidate's full six-component
predictions, errors and counterexamples. These large errors describe failed
controls, not an estimated coordinate range.

One bounded feasibility run assembled a 132,124-byte, one-page C8 temporary
source from the pinned C8 page-1 index row and its text/descriptor/image
chain, using at most 65,536 bytes per copy request. The row's absolute spans
were retained; unknown header space was zeroed. The independent source reader
confirmed the original text hash and five image hashes/dimensions, and the
pinned black-box converter produced a one-page, five-draw PDF accepted by
qpdf, MuPDF and Poppler. The temporary source/PDF hashes were
`13e4ff97b0969ceade7449455c59199fba30b0b7f31b0df384ca1b317746aa2b`
and `8d576e41d5888274593519ac64886b13884ca4a1bb86a760bdbc0b232578072c`.
The converted source reused text, image bytes and unknown row values from the
same pinned document, so this is a structural feasibility check and **not**
independent-document validation or a new placement-rule test. Both temporary
files were deleted after the run.

## JFIF batch result

The four predeclared edits above were run twice each against the pinned
black-box reference. All eight conversions succeeded and were repeatable.
Independent qpdf, MuPDF and Poppler inspection agreed with the #107 baseline
on page count, MediaBoxes, ordered image identity and every CTM. Each edited
PDF changed exactly the selected JPEG stream; no other stream or page geometry
changed. Thus these APP0 fields show no placement dependence for the two
tested source pages. They cannot establish an x/y rule for the other pages.

Batch counts: planned 4, attempted 4, completed 4, repeatable 4, passing
4, failing 0, skipped 0, unsupported 0, placement changes 0, causal
candidates 0. The 27 source files, six baseline PDFs, matrix, oracle,
reference report and pinned environment passed before/after audit. Maximum
ranged source read was 65,536 bytes; the hash auditor used at most 1 MiB per
read. Peak observed harness VmHWM was 26,692 KiB, converter child VmHWM
41,260 KiB, PDF-tool RSS 42,636 KiB, PDF-tool output 790,923 bytes, and
retained temporary session size 60,753,844 bytes. The converter timeout was
180 seconds; no timeout occurred. These are measured peaks of this batch,
not resource limits for arbitrary documents. The machine report and all
private artifacts remain outside Git.

## Text-component batch, predeclared before conversion

The JFIF batch leaves the opaque per-page text span as the leading source
component to test. The next batch has **two** temporary source copies, one
per variant, each converted twice in fresh directories (four conversions
maximum). A whole text-span transplant requires changing the row's text
offset and length too; it is therefore a **component test**, not a
one-variable coordinate-field probe. No individual text byte or row field
will be assigned coordinate meaning from its outcome.

| Probe | Target row and original text | Donor text | Write donor to target | New target-row `+0/+4` | First descriptor |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| C8-text | p1 row `[80,100)`, text `[220,14766)` | p2 `[132124,142814)` (10,690 bytes) | `[4076,14766)` | `[80,88)` = LE i32 `(4076,10690)` | 14,766 |
| HN-A-text | p16 row `[16664,16684)`, text `[953320,960821)` | p22 `[1354683,1360027)` (5,344 bytes) | `[955477,960821)` | `[16664,16672)` = LE i32 `(955477,5344)` | 960,821 |

The row spans and text offsets/lengths are independently checked container
metadata from #61/#107. For each copy, preserve the target row's remaining
12 bytes, all other rows, the first descriptor address, every image
descriptor and payload, and total source length. Before conversion, require
the new target text hash to equal the #107 donor text hash and require the
independent source reader to find the target's unchanged image count,
offsets, hashes, dimensions and order. Audit the entire original and mutated
source hash before and after both conversions. Copy and hash with at most
64 KiB and 1 MiB read requests respectively; retain no source bytes or PDFs
in Git.

For a placement-informative outcome, the converter must retain HN-A's
68 pages/91 ordered draws or C8's 7 pages/34 ordered draws, the target
page's 2 or 5 draws, baseline MediaBox and first-image CTM, all image raw
stream hashes/dimensions/order, and every non-target page's MediaBox and six
CTM components. Require qpdf, MuPDF and Poppler to agree and both runs to be
repeatable. Changed target supplemental CTMs under these guards would show
that the **combined text/row-address component** affects placement. No
change is only a negative result for these donor pages. Rejection, changed
draw count, changed image identity or nonlocal geometry is `UNSUPPORTED` for
placement inference. The positional rule remains `UNKNOWN` until an exact
field and formula pass the independent validation requirement.

## Text-component batch result

Both predeclared source copies passed the independent container checks and
were accepted by the pinned black-box converter twice each. The four PDFs
were repeatable. The two target pages retained their original MediaBoxes,
first-image CTMs, ordered image identities, dimensions and raw-stream
hashes; all 73 non-target pages across the two documents retained their
MediaBoxes and every image CTM. qpdf, MuPDF and Poppler agreed on the
parsed outputs. Both source copies and all 27 pinned corpus files passed
before/after SHA-256 audits.

| Probe | Mutated source SHA-256 | Mutated PDF SHA-256 | Changed bytes / coalesced offset runs | Target supplemental CTMs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C8 p1 ← p2 text | `68622f983ed8e403df81fb666ffd0a06b0f57a7c28228ae0109b7509636eb777` | `81d684dd092727fb794426145e5bac5b48caf8985b8957bee991cea153c0f170` | 10,652 / 45 (4 row, 10,648 text) | 4/4 translations changed |
| HN-A p16 ← p22 text | `5df8bc22927ba44afad994e93548c4ac7cdbac80e02a2fa37ca90644df415008` | `9e4f111c9ef5c07698240aa5d33de7a1fb665e8758e23312344143c1afd98aae` | 5,324 / 27 (4 row, 5,320 text) | 1/1 translation changed |

In each case, the target additional-image **x/y translations exactly equal
the donor page's translations in the same draw positions**: 5/5 draws at
the PDF extractor's recorded decimal precision. This equality was checked
after the conversion by comparing the recorded target CTMs in the external
report (SHA-256
`ca3ea76ea961015ecee00af0da7062d6f0ba4e1de3bb3167517a1b4671c0bd50`)
with the donor CTMs in the committed #107 oracle. The external derived
metadata-only comparison (SHA-256
`6048d2167c11374b06cc4945bf1c09d9301c06f716ac58db04c9b9b2ffde890e`)
records 5/5 exact matches; no additional black-box conversion was run.
The diagnostic now includes this donor comparison in future machine reports.
The target JPEG sizes and scales stayed with the target images, so this
correspondence is not explained by matching image sizes. The changed input
comprises both the opaque text bytes and the
index row's text address/length. It provides causal evidence that this
**combined component** influences supplemental placement; it does not
identify the coordinate encoding, units, origin, axis, rounding, valid
range or a formula. It cannot satisfy the two *one-variable field* probes or
independent-document validation required for a general rule.

Batch counts: planned 2, attempted 2, completed 2, passing 2, failing 0,
skipped 0, unsupported 0, repeatable 2, component placement effects 2.
Six baseline PDF hashes, the matrix, oracle, reference report and full
pinned environment passed before/after audit. Maximum ranged source read
was 65,536 bytes, and file hashing used at most 1 MiB per request. Observed
peaks were harness VmHWM 25,764 KiB, converter child VmHWM 41,320 KiB,
PDF-tool RSS 42,708 KiB, tool output 322,609 bytes, and temporary session
size 30,393,217 bytes (30,376,912 bytes retained at completion). The
converter timeout was 180 seconds; no timeout occurred. The machine report,
changed-offset runs and private artifacts remain outside Git.

## Measurements and decision rule

For every requested input, pin and check the #22/#61 matrix, #107 oracle,
reference source/PDF hashes, Python checkout revision, package and native
library hashes, PDF tool hashes, command, environment and timeouts before and
after. A missing or changed explicit input fails; a clean clone reports
`NOT_RUN` and zero private comparisons. Capture subprocess output within a
fixed byte budget, kill/reap its process group on timeout or failure, and
measure peak ranged read, process RSS and temporary disk. Read one source
page at a time and keep bounded buffers.

Each probe report records its checked source ID, page/image, field span and
changed byte positions, original/mutant source SHA-256, conversion status,
PDF SHA-256 if produced, ordered image identity, MediaBox and all six CTM
components before/after, independent qpdf/MuPDF/Poppler agreement, and any
unsupported or skipped outcome. Private bytes, rendered pixels and generated
PDFs stay external. No skipped case counts as a pass.

A proposed rule must match all 36 discovery and 14 predeclared validation
additional draws within an explicitly stated numeric tolerance while also
matching image order/identity, scale and MediaBox. To claim a general rule,
require either two repeated, structurally valid one-variable causal probes
whose x/y change agrees with the prediction and leaves unrelated geometry
unchanged, or newly generated independent HN-A/C8 documents reserved until
the formula is frozen. Report exact supported variants, image types and
document counts. If no rule survives, report `UNKNOWN` with attempted,
passing, failing, skipped and unsupported counts. Keep #10 blocked and add
no guessed compositor. The remaining source-field isolation is tracked by
[#111](https://github.com/rwv/caj2pdf-rust/issues/111), and exact rule
validation by [#112](https://github.com/rwv/caj2pdf-rust/issues/112); #112
blocks #10.
